# Credit Risk Assessment

This project make my team a champion of The Data Analytics Competition 2024, organized by Ho Chi Minh university of Banking.

## Topic

This project builds a machine learning model to assess user credit risk.

## Data Information

This project, we use internal bank data and data from the Credit Information Center (CIC). 

## Table of contents

* Data Loading
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature Engineering
* Model Building
* Evaluation

## Conclusion

1. In this project, we use XGBoost to perform customer risk classification.The results are as follows: Accuracy: 0.954, F1-Score: 0.954, AUC: 0.969
2. Additionally, we introduce an approach to effectively build and tackle a classification problem.
3. Future work includes applying other algorithms and tuning parameters to achieve the highest possible efficiency.
